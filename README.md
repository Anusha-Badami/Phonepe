*******PHONEPE PULSE DATA VISUALISATION AND EXPLORATION*******


***Problem Statement:***

The Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository contains a vast amount of data encompassing various metrics and statistics. The objective is to extract, process, and visualize this data in a user-friendly manner, thereby enabling efficient exploration and analysis.


***Problem Objective:***

The project aims to develop a user-friendly tool leveraging technologies like Python, Pandas, MySQL, Streamlit, and Plotly. This tool will allow users to interactively explore the data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository through a live geo-visualization dashboard, enhancing data-driven decision-making in the Fintech domain.


***Approach:***

1. Data Extraction: Clone the GitHub repository using scripting to fetch the data.
2. Data Transformation: Utilize Python and Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
3. Database Insertion: Connect to MySQL using mysql-connector-python and insert transformed data.
4. Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
5. Data Retrieval: Fetch data from MySQL using mysql-connector-python to update the dashboard.
6. Deployment: Ensure security, efficiency, and user-friendliness; deploy the dashboard publicly.


***Results:***

The project will culminate in a live geo-visualization dashboard presenting insights from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. With at least 10 dropdown options, users can select various metrics for display. Stored in MySQL, the dashboard will dynamically update, offering valuable insights for decision-making in the Fintech domain.
